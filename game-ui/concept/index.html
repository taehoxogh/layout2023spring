    <h1>Game UI Concept</h1>
    
    <p>
        <h3>What game are we modeling?</h3>
        I will be modeling a battle game like Pokemon. Each player will take turns and select the attack moves of their monsters to win against the opponents. If one side doesnâ€™t have any monsters left with no energy left, the game will be ended and they will lose. The player will be able to manage potions to keep the character alive. They can also change to different monsters for the battles. They also have chance to give up if they want to stop the battle as soon as possible.
        <br>

        <h3>What is appropriate stylistically?</h3>
        <img src="gameUI_wireframe.png" alt="mainpage" width="640" 
        height="416"/>
        <br>

        <h3>What controls/displays does the game require, and how do these components handle the four aspects of interactions?</h3>
        The game will require and include the UI components like 4 Different attack move options (Interaction), number of attacks left (Status), health bar for each monster with exact number displayed (Status), 4 different main options (Monster, Potion, Battle, Give up) (Identification), Attack orders (Status), Level indicator (Status), Number of monsters in possess and left (Status). Message bar (Feedback), Players ID (Identification).
        <br>

        <h3>How do we translate our visual intent into html and css?</h3>
        I will do the rapid prototyping of the game using Figma at different sizes, then I will translate my visual intent into html and css.
        <br>

        <h3>How do we build html/css structures that can convey rapidly-changing visual information?</h3>
        I could use some Javascript features to convey rapidly-changing visual information in the html/css structures.
        <br>

        <h3>How do we handle screen-size variability?</h3>
        I will use responsive web design features for all different size devices using CSS so that users can enjoy the game without any obstacles.
